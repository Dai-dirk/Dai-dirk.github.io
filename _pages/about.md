I am a final-year PhD student at the State Key Laboratory of Integrated Chips and Systems, Fudan University, supervised by [Prof. Lingli Wang](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/60/3c/c31155a352316/page.htm) and [Prof. Wai-shing Luk](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=zVrDetsAAAAJ). I received my B.S. degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) in 2021, supervised by [Prof. Xin Chen](https://faculty.nuaa.edu.cn/xchen/zh_CN/index.htm). I have published papers as the first author in several top-tier journals and conferences. In addition, I served as a core contributor or technical lead on several industry–academia collaborative projects with leading companies such as Huawei. 

Most of my work is **open source**, and the repositories are available at [link](https://github.com/Dai-dirk). I enjoy collaborating with others and am committed to making reconfigurable architectures more flexible and widely applicable.

My research interests mainly include:

- **Reconfigurable Architecture: Hardware**: Coarse-grained reconfigurable architectures (CGRA), Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
- **Reconfigurable Architecture: Software**: CGRA Compiler (e.g., LLVM-based Front-end, CGRA Mapping), FPGA CAD (e.g., Synthesis flow for DSP block)
- **Approximate Computing**: Transcendental Function Approximation and Hardware Implementation
- **System on Chip Design**: CPU-Accelerator Heterogeneous System

**I am currently on the job market and open to research and industrial positions in computer architecture and accelerator design.**
